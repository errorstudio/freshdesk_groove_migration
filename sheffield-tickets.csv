So the format is https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/[slug of event]/book-tickets?instance_id=[spektrix id] Hope this clarifies? Ed http://help.error.agency/helpdesk/tickets/1466"
"CLIENT: Sheffield Theatres","r.offord@sheffieldtheatres.co.uk","Casting on Contractions Page","Hi Ruth, Is this worth attacking in the March 2017 sprint of work? http://help.error.agency/helpdesk/tickets/856 Regards Martin Chapman Fromm","Hello, We've just announced the cast for Contractions but the design on the page seems to be set up for 4 cast members or more. Are we able to change the settings on this please so we don't get this big purple block? https://www.sheffieldtheatres.co.uk/whats-on/contractions Thanks RuthHello, Is there any possibility this could be looked at please? The page looks rather strange with the huge purple strip. Thanks RuthAndy is this solveable? You wrap in bunches of 4 in js. EdHi Ed, This ticket refers to how the cast headshots appear in the panel on the right-hand side of the page. See screenshot below. Normally, we have more than 2 cast members in a production, meaning the block that's been created to house the headshot photos would feature 4 people and there would be no gap between the photos and the creative team list with director etc. However, as Contractions only has 2 cast members, it means that we then have a wide purple gap between the photos and the creative team list. We are wondering if there's a way to manipulate the settings here, so that if we ever have only 2 cast members on a show in the future, the headshots could display in a way that doesn't leave the wide gap? Might that be possible? Thanks, EmilyHi Ruth, Is this worth attacking in the March 2017 sprint of work? http://help.error.agency/helpdesk/tickets/856 Regards Martin Chapman Fromm"

No Man's Land Not Showing Sold Out Ticket comment Hi Ed, Yes unfortunately No Man's Land finished on Saturday but on Friday every instance was sold out but it still said book tickets on the show page. I just wanted to raise it as I think it'll need resolving. Thanks Ruth http://help.error.agency/helpdesk/tickets/989 989 http://help.error.agency/helpdesk/tickets/989 Thanks The Error team. http://help.error.agency/helpdesk/tickets/989 Thanks The Error team.Is this something we want to suggest is for the sprint in March?Could do. Haven't progressed this, feels like a bug somewhere but need time to think about it.Hello, I'm bringing this ticket back to the front as we just had a problem on Everybody's Talking About Jamie that I don't want to repeat. On Thursday we were sold out of all performances until Saturday, however when looking on the show page it still says 'Book tickets' instead of 'Sold Out'. I believe this is an ongoing issue with the 'price sync' which I have already spoken to Martin about. Can we please get to the bottom of this problem? It is also affecting sold out events which then have tickets go back on sale (it never updates on the website page for example). Are you able to provide an update soon on how we can sort this out for good? Thanks Ruth@ed&nbsp;For next sprint."

I have been planning here for us to potentially have to do some work to get that site updated for early September (when we're planning to put the events on sale). However, after having a think about it I don't think I can think of anything specific that needs doing as we'll just add the events in the same way we did last year. Can you think if there is any work needed from your side to 'launch' the site with the events again this year? If so I was going to suggest we booked in a couple of days in August to make sure we have the time to work on it.
